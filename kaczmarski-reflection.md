1. What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I was struggling understanding the overall concept of how to clone a repository onto the computer and then access it.

2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

Cloning, pushing, and resolving merge conflicts were clarified during the GPS.

3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

We asked about the differences between git pull, git merge, and git fetch.

4. What still confuses you about Git?

I think I have a much better grasp of Git now. It was great to see how it works in practice with another person involved. I can't think of anything that still confuses me.

5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

It went really well! Grace is very nice. It was great to pair with someone who is a beginner as well, so I wasn't embarassed when I was struggling.
