* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
  Before the GPS session, I was confused as to what the differences between "git fetch" and "git pull" were. In addition, I was still having trouble keeping commit messages in the present tense. Also, I was/am still having a little bit of trouble with key commands with respect to moving files between brnaches, but I'm sure that will come with practice and time.
* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
  Our guide gave us tips that really helped me understand the differences between "fetch" and "pull," and I know that I will always remember the difference between the two now! "fetch" will download whatever changes onto your local computer, but it will not merge those changes into the branch until you command it to. Whereas, "pull" downloads and merges changes automatically.
* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
  I asked my pair how much coding experience she had, since I have close to none.. and luckily we were on the same page! I asked my guide all of the concepts I was having trouble with (mentioned above). In addition, I asked both my pair and our guide for tips when I hit roadblocks while codings.
* What still confuses you about Git?
  I think that it would improve over time and with practice, but I get confused with terminology now and then.
* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
  It was really fun! My pair and I got along quite well, and it was nice being able to get immediate feedback from both my pair and the guide while programming. That way, I knew immediately if I had done something correct, or if I had taken a wrong turn. Also, being able to ask questions as I was coding was very helpful. I enjoyed it a lot.
